# How to test code in Python - A Brief Reminder  

## Why this project?

I just thought it would be good to have a reminder of how to test code in Python, and demonstrate what I know of it. 

## Important

You want your test file to be able to use the functions set in the file to be tested. Therefor you can import the file into it. 
Also you want the 'unittest' function to be imported into your test file to use its methods. 

## Functions to keep track of 

The two main things I learned from this test were:

	Checking Equality 
	
	Checking if the statements raises an Error 

This is acheived through the use of assertEquals and assertRaises. 


## How did I make this project?

Python 

JetBrains PyCharm IDE 

That's why the code may be a bit different from what you find on online samples.

I think the rest of the code is self-explanatory as it is a simple script.
